## 🚀 Project Setup & Run Instructions

Follow the steps below to run the backend agents, master orchestrator API, and the frontend interfaces.

---

### 📌 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.8+
* Node.js and npm

---

### 🧠 Step 1: Run Python Agents

Start the core backend Python agents:

```bash
python eda_agent.py
python graphing_agent.py
python master_orchestrator_api.py
```

> 💡 Run these in separate terminal windows or use a process manager like `tmux` or `screen`.

---

### 🌐 Step 2: Start Orchestrator Frontend (Backend Server)

Navigate to the backend directory and start the Node.js server:

```bash
cd orchestrator_frontend/backend
npm install  # First-time setup
npm start
```

---

### 💻 Step 3: Start Orchestrator Frontend (Client UI)

Open another terminal and run the frontend React app:

```bash
cd orchestrator_frontend/frontend
npm install  # First-time setup
npm start
```
